# Cross Product
1) ```cpp
   template<typename T2>
   constexpr vector& cross_product(const vector<T2, Size>& rhs);
   ```
2) ```cpp
   template<typename T, typename T2, std::size_t Size1>
   constexpr vector<T, Size1> cross_product(vector<T, Size1> lhs, const vector<T2, Size1>& rhs);
   ```
3) ```cpp
   template<Concepts::arithmetic_char_const_excluded T, Concepts::arithmetic_char_const_excluded T2>
   constexpr auto complex_cross_product(const std::complex<T>& lhs, const std::complex<T> rhs);
   ```
<br>

1) Computes the cross product of the current instance and `rhs`, storing the result in `this`.<br>
2) Same as 1), but the result is stored in a new `vector`, which has the same size and type of `lhs`.<br>
3) This function performs the cross product between two complex numbers. https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition:Vector_Cross_Product/Complex<br>

The cross product is defined for both arithmetic and complex types. For the latter, a "normal" cross product is performed on the conjugates of the complex elements. (See the definition of the inner product below).
<br>In any case, the types of the elements of both vectors must be the same (this is to avoid mistakes such as trying to obtain the cross product between a complex vector and a non complex vector).<br>
**Note**: The cross product between two vectors is *only* defined for 3D vectors, that is, the size of the vector must be equal to 3.
<br> - For vectors whose underlying container is `std::array`, these functions do not exist if the size is not equal to 3.
<br> - For vectors whose underlying container is `std::array`, an assert is performed. If the assert is disabled and the size is not 3, the function still attempts to perform the cross product, and undefined behavior occurs.

# Inner Product (dot product)
1) ```cpp
   template<Concepts::underlying_vector_type T, std::size_t Size>
   constexpr T inner_product(const vector<T, Size>& lhs, const vector<T, Size>& other)
   ```
2) ```cpp
   template<Concepts::arithmetic_char_const_excluded T, Concepts::arithmetic_char_const_excluded T2>
   constexpr auto complex_dot_product(const std::complex<T>& lhs, const std::complex<T2>& rhs);
   ```
<br>

1) Computes the dot product between `lhs` and `other`. The result that is returned has the type `T`, which is the type of the passed vectors. To avoid mistakes such as trying to obtain the dot product between complex and non complex vectors,
both underlying vector types must be the same.
If `std::complex` is used as the underlying type, then the inner product performs the following formula: $âˆ‘ conj(a) * b$, with `conj(lhs[i]) == conj(ai)` and `other[i] == bi`.<br>
2) Performs the dot product between two complex numbers. https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition:Dot_Product/Complex

# Examples
```cpp
#include "vector.h"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
	MathLbr::vector<std::complex<double>> c{ {{2,4},{6,7},{3,3}} };
	MathLbr::vector<std::complex<double>> d{ {{5,5},{9,8},{9,9}} };
	std::cout << "inner product: " << MathLbr::Vector::inner_product(c, d) << std::endl;

	std::cout << "cross product: " << MathLbr::Vector::cross_product(c, d);
	c.cross_product(d);
}
```
